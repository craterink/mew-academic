While at Stanford, I TA'd [CS109](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/) and [CS107](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/), and lectured CS109 during the summer quarter of 2020. With funding from [Well-being at Stanford](https://vaden.stanford.edu/well-being), I designed and taught the Stanford course [CS82SI: Workshops for Wellbeing in Tech](http://cs82si.stanford.edu/) in Spring 2020 together with my amazing coinstructors [Sonia Garcia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soniapgarcia/) and [Nik Marda](https://nikmarda.com/). During the summers of 2019 and 2021, I taught Python and Javascript to brilliant high schoolers in Palestine as part of the [Code.X](https://www.codedotx.org/) [Code For Palestine](https://www.codedotx.org/code-for-palestine) program.

I love to teach and am always interested in hearing about opportunities! ðŸ¤“
