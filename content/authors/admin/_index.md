I research large language model safety at [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/), a Toronto-based startup building a developer-focused NLP platform. (We're hiring! Shoot me an email at cooper at cohere dot ai and say hi ðŸ™‚.) I recently graduated from the MSc [computer science](https://cs.stanford.edu/research) program at Stanford University, where I studied human-centered artificial intelligence and analyzed misinformation with the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/io) as part of the [Election Integrity Partnership](https://www.eipartnership.net/).

My research and writing is generally at the intersection of technology and society. Current interests include AI safety, fairness, and ethics; the effects of AI on the online information ecosystem and influence operations; contrastive learning for natural language understanding; and safety and performance evaluation of large language generation models.

Outside of work and research, you can usually find me near the water ðŸŒŠðŸŒŠðŸŒŠ
